Project Title :-
    Prediction of Social Media Consumer Behavior using Machine Learning 

Description :-
    1. Developed a machine learning model to predict consumer activity on one social media platform based on data from another platform.
    2. Proficiently done Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Pandas and Seaborn library. Applied Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and XGBoost Algorithms for Conducting a comparative analysis of the accuracy of each algorithm.
    3. Hyper Parameter Tuning was conducted using GridSearchCV. Random Forest achieved the highest R2-score of 0.92.
